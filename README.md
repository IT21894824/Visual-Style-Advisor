## Key Features

### Hair Style Transformation and Realistic Simulation for Personalized Recommendations. - Vikasitha M.K.I. IT21180798
- Analyze facial features and preferences to recommend personalized hairstyles, simulate real-time virtual hairstyle transformations, and provide culturally diverse and trend-based options for enhanced user styling decisions.

### Personalized Hair Color Recommendation Using Deep Learning. - Prasadi S.A.D.T. IT21894824
- Leverage deep learning and image processing to provide real-time, tailored hair color suggestions based on unique user features such as skin tone, eye color, and natural hair color, while considering lifestyle, preferences, and professional trends for enhanced user satisfaction and customization.

### Clothing Recommendation with Virtual Fit-On - Shaakir J.H.M.​ IT21322280
- Create fitness schedules using BMI and caloric burn metrics.
- Monitor real-time data through smartwatches.

### Makeup Recommendation Through Nose Structure and Cheekbone Identification - Senarathne D.R.​ IT21213144​
-Analyze facial features, focusing on the nose structure and cheekbones, to provide personalized makeup recommendations that enhance facial symmetry, define contours, and highlight features, offering a more precise and tailored approach compared to traditional generalized methods.

### User Dashboard 
- A single interface for monitoring all health metrics.
- Insights on diet, exercise, and stress.
